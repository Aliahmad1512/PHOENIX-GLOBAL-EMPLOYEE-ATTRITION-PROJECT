### Business Problem : 
Phoenix Global has been facing the issue of constant employee attrition Close to 15 of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company.

### Goal : 
To understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition in the company. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their
workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. We are required to model the probability of attrition using a Logistic Regression. The results obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace. We will also model the probability of attrition using different classifiers like Random Forest, SVM, etc for better results.
